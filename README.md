## Recursive Spectral Modularity Partitioning and Centrality Analysis

This project performs **recursive spectral modularity partitioning** to detect communities in Zachary's Karate Club graph and analyzes how **centrality metrics evolve** after each split.

## 🔍 Description

The code implements the following pipeline:

1. **Graph Loading**:
   - Loads the classic *Karate Club* social network graph using NetworkX.

2. **Recursive Spectral Community Detection**:
   - Uses spectral modularity bisection (Newman's method) to recursively split the graph.
   - Communities are divided based on the leading eigenvector of the modularity matrix.
   - Splitting continues until no further modularity gain is possible.

3. **Centrality Metric Computation (at each iteration)**:
   - **Degree Centrality**
   - **Betweenness Centrality**
   - **Closeness Centrality**
   - **Clustering Coefficient**

4. **Visualization**:
   - Graph layout is fixed across all iterations for consistent visual comparison.
   - Communities are colored after every split.
   - Metric evolution is visualized per node using heatmaps.
